This is my plan to make a AI voice assistant named SIOP and I will make it better and better in upcoming days
by learning more about machine learning algorithm and python modules

-----------------------------version_1-------------------------------------
## "Hey SIOP" detection
First of all I will teach my AI to detect only "Hey SIOP" from other ambient noises, keyboard and mouse
clicking, and various random noises.For this I have to train my model for this giving a lot 
of data.


## Speech recognition
I will use some opensource package of google for recognition of what I say. I will convert my
speech into text and search for various things.

## Text to speech
I will teach it to pronounce anything written in english. It will help to reply to us.

# Performing various tasks
I will teach it do various tasks like :
1. opening programs
2. Sending emails
3. searching wikipedia,google,youtube
5. playing music
6. saying date and time
7. saying weather
------------------------------version_2-------------------------------------------
## My voice detection
Once it learns to detect "Hey SIOP" from other sounds I will teach it to detect my voice only.Except
me nobody can use it .If someone says "Hey SIOP" then it detects it and communicate with phrase like
"You donot have permission to use me because you are not Mr. Aryan".For this again I have to train this
model feeding millions of my voice data

## Speech recognition
I will teach SIOP to recognize nepali language.

## Text to speech
I will teach it to pronounce anything written in Nepali language. It will help to reply to us.


## Performing various tasks
I will keep adding more things as I learn more.
